## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the EOPF-Zarr GDAL plugin, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@your-domain.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in the repository
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use GPG key if available

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
- **Your Contact Information**: For follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution**: Target within 30 days for critical issues

## Security Considerations

### Data Handling

The EOPF-Zarr plugin handles geospatial data which may contain sensitive information:

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Memory Safety**: Following GDAL's memory management patterns
- **Buffer Overflows**: Proper bounds checking on all array operations
- **Path Traversal**: Validation of file paths and Zarr structure

### Network Security

When accessing cloud-based data:

- **HTTPS**: Always use encrypted connections when possible
- **Authentication**: Secure handling of credentials
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevent hanging connections
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate URLs and paths

### Common Vulnerabilities

We actively monitor for:

- **Buffer Overflows**: In data reading and chunk processing
- **Integer Overflows**: In size calculations
- **Path Traversal**: In file access operations
- **Denial of Service**: Through malformed data
- **Memory Leaks**: In dataset handling

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review

All code changes go through:
- Peer review for security implications
- Static analysis tools when available
- Manual security assessment for critical paths

### Testing

Security-focused testing includes:
- Fuzzing with malformed Zarr data
- Testing with extremely large datasets
- Boundary condition testing
- Error handling verification

### Dependencies

We maintain security by:
- Regularly updating GDAL and other dependencies
- Monitoring security advisories for dependencies
- Using only trusted and well-maintained libraries

## Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities reported privately first
2. **Fix Development**: Work with reporter to develop fixes
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of security fixes
4. **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users can update

### Timeline

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Disclosed within 90 days
- **High Severity**: Disclosed within 6 months
- **Medium/Low Severity**: Disclosed within 1 year

### Credit

Security researchers who report vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in security advisories (if desired)
- Listed in release notes
- Acknowledged in documentation

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

Security updates are announced through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes with security tags
- Email notifications (if subscribed)
- Project documentation updates

### Update Recommendations

When security updates are released:
- **Critical**: Update immediately
- **High**: Update within 1 week
- **Medium**: Update within 1 month
- **Low**: Update at next regular maintenance

## Security Configuration

### Best Practices

When using the plugin:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Validate Data**: Don't trust untrusted data sources
3. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for remote data
4. **Access Control**: Limit file system access appropriately
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual behavior

### Environment Variables

Security-relevant environment variables:
- `GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN`: Prevent directory scanning
- `GDAL_HTTP_TIMEOUT`: Set appropriate timeouts
- `CPL_CURL_VERBOSE`: Enable for debugging only

## Known Security Considerations

### Zarr Format Risks

- **Malformed Metadata**: Could cause parsing errors
- **Large Chunks**: Could cause memory exhaustion
- **Nested Structures**: Could cause stack overflow
- **Compression Bombs**: Highly compressed malicious data

### Cloud Access Risks

- **Credential Exposure**: Ensure credentials are protected
- **Network Attacks**: Use encrypted connections
- **Data Integrity**: Verify data hasn't been tampered with

### GDAL Integration Risks

- **Plugin Loading**: Ensure plugins are from trusted sources
- **Memory Management**: Follow GDAL's patterns strictly
- **Thread Safety**: Ensure thread-safe operations

## Compliance

### Standards

We aim to comply with:
- **GDAL Security Guidelines**
- **Industry Best Practices** for C++ development
- **OWASP Guidelines** for relevant areas

### Auditing

- Regular security reviews of code changes
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static analysis when available
- Community security assessments
