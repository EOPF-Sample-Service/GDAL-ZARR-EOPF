# Roadmap for Implementing a Zarr Driver in GDAL

## 1. Preparation & Familiarization

- **Understand GDAL’s Architecture**
  - Review the GDAL driver model, including:
    - How new raster drivers are registered.
    - How `GDALDataset` and `GDALRasterBand` are subclassed.
    - Differences between the classic 2D API and the multidimensional API.
  - Read through the [Raster Driver Implementation Tutorial](https://gdal.org/en/stable/tutorials/raster_driver_tut.html) and the [Multidimensional Raster API Tutorial](https://gdal.org/en/stable/tutorials/mdim_api_tutorial.html).

- **Study the Zarr Format**
  - Familiarize yourself with the Zarr V2 (and experimental V3) specifications.
  - Review the [GDAL Zarr Driver Documentation](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/zarr.html) and related OGC Testbed 17 reports to understand:
    - Intended behavior.
    - Limitations.
    - Extensions (e.g., CRS handling).

- **Set Up the Development Environment**
  - Clone the GDAL repository and set up the build environment (preferably using CMake).
  - Install recommended dependencies (e.g., liblz4, libxz, libzstd, libblosc) to test various compression methods.

## 2. Design & Planning

- **Define Scope and Requirements**
  - Decide if you’re:
    - Implementing a new Zarr driver from scratch, or
    - Extending the existing one.
  - List the required features:
    - Full read and write support (including creation options).
    - Support for both the classic 2D raster API and the multidimensional API.
    - Handling georeferencing (e.g., using a special `_CRS` attribute with WKT/PROJJSON).
    - Integration with GDAL Virtual File Systems for local and remote (e.g., S3) storage.

- **Draft a Design Document**
  - Outline the driver classes:
    - Custom `GDALDataset` subclass for Zarr.
    - Custom `GDALRasterBand` implementations.
    - GDALDriver registration function.
  - Map out how to read the hierarchical Zarr structure (groups, arrays, attributes) and convert it into GDAL’s data model.
  - Plan for:
    - Error handling.
    - Performance optimizations (e.g., multi-threaded caching).
    - Integration tests.

- **Team Review & Feedback**
  - Present the design document to team.
  - Adjust based on feedback and organizational coding guidelines.

## 3. Implementation

- **Reading Support**
  - Implement the `Open()` method to detect Zarr datasets:
    - Recognize folders containing key files such as `.zgroup`, `.zarray`, or consolidated metadata.
  - Map the Zarr hierarchy (groups and arrays) to GDAL’s multidimensional model and classic 2D datasets (e.g., exposing 2D slices when needed).

- **Writing (Creation) Support**
  - Implement `GDALDriver::Create()` and/or `CreateCopy()` methods for Zarr.
  - Support creation options (e.g., compression type, chunk sizes, naming conventions).
  - Handle attribute writing, including CRS via the special `_CRS` attribute.

- **Integration with GDAL Core & Virtual IO**
  - Ensure the driver works with GDAL’s Virtual File Systems (e.g., `/vsimem/`, `/vsizip/`, `/vsicurl/`) to support both local and remote datasets.
  - Handle multithreaded caching if applicable.

---

## 4. Testing & Validation

- **Unit and Integration Tests**
  - Write tests covering all driver capabilities:
    - Reading existing Zarr datasets.
    - Writing new datasets.
    - Round-tripping (read–write–read) scenarios.
  - Use GDAL utilities such as:
    - `gdalinfo`
    - `gdal_translate`
    - `gdalmdiminfo`
  - Validate the implementation against sample datasets.

- **Real-World Scenarios**
  - Test with datasets produced by popular tools like xarray/rioxarray.
  - Verify that:
    - Georeferencing works as expected.
    - Multidimensional access is correct.
    - Compression options are properly applied.

---

## 5. Documentation & Finalization

- **Update Documentation**
  - Add or update the driver documentation in the GDAL docs.
  - Provide examples and usage notes, including:
    - Known limitations (e.g., experimental support for Zarr V3 if applicable).
  
- **Code Review & Integration**
  - Solicit feedback from team members.
  - Iterate on the implementation.
  - Integrate into the GDAL codebase following the project’s contribution guidelines.
  - Prepare merge requests and respond to review comments.

- **Release & Maintenance**
  - Once merged, monitor the driver in nightly builds.
  - Address any reported issues or bugs.
  - Plan for periodic maintenance and future enhancements.
